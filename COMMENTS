I was able to create client's session on server, and modify files on server from client. 
I sent AES-CCM encrypted commands from client to server for this, so no outsider could see the messages and decrypt them. That is secure communication.
The username and password were stored in server, so it gave a real feel of client server communication.

I enjoyed this assignment mostly, more than previous ones as this feels more practical.

I didn't a proper working VM so getting communication between machines is a bit of a problem. It works fine on localhost though.
